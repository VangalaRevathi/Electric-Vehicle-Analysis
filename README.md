**Problem Statement:** 
AtliQ Motors is an automotive giant from the USA specializing in electric vehicles 
(EV). In the last 5 years, their market share rose to 25% in electric and hybrid 
vehicles segment in North America. As a part of their expansion plans, they wanted 
to launch their bestselling models in India where their market share is less than 2%. 
Bruce Haryali, the chief of AtliQ Motors India wanted to do a detailed market study 
of existing EV/Hybrid market in India before proceeding further. Bruce gave this task 
to the data analytics team of AtliQ motors and Peter Pandey is the data analyst 
working in this team.

**Recommendations:**

1.A combination of Gujarat for its industrial support and Maharashtra for its infrastructure and strong automotive ecosystem would be ideal for establishing an EV manufacturing unit.

2.The positive correlation between the no.of charging stations, EVsales and penetration rate indicates that with the increase in charging stations the EV sales will also increase.
