When analyzing the number of electric vehicles (EVs) sold, there are several key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be derived to assess market performance, consumer behavior, and business strategy. Below are some important KPIs you can track from EV sales data:

### 1. **Total Number of EVs Sold**
   - **Definition**: The total count of electric vehicles sold over a specific time period (monthly, quarterly, annually).
   - **Purpose**: Provides an overall measure of sales volume and growth.

### 2. **EV Market Share**
   - **Definition**: The percentage of total vehicle sales represented by electric vehicles.
   - **Formula**: 
     \[
