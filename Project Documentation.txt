rewrite a linkedin post to explain my ev project with emojis and point wise 

Hello everyone, 

I am excited to share my first Resume Challenge of CodeBasic on Electric Vehicle Analysis experience and learnings with you.
 Project Objective:AtliQ Motors is a leading U.S. electric vehicle company, holds a 25% market share in North America.It plans to expand into India, where its market share is under 2%.

Focus of the study: EV and hybrid sector in India to ensure a successful launch.
DAshboard contains:
1.MAkers Trends
2.Geographic Trends
3.Seasonal Trends
4.MAker's & State Correlations

My learnings:

1.Learned about the Automotive domain KPI's like 
Compounded GRowth RAte:It is a measure of the average annual growth rate of an investment, sales, or any metric over a specified time period, assuming that growth occurs at a steady rate.
 PEnetration RAte:the percentage of total vehicles sold or in use within a specific region, time period, or market segment that are electric vehicles (EVs).
Projected EV Sales:Projected EV Sales refers to the estimated number of electric vehicles expected to be sold in the future based on historical data, trends, and predictive models.
Revenue Growth Rate:
Revenue Growth Rate measures the percentage increase in revenue over a specific period. It shows how quickly a company's or market's revenue is growing year over year or over multiple years.

2.Learned to use historical and projected data for making evidence-based decisions.

3.Created visualizations to represent sales trends, revenue growth, penetration rates, and regional performance.

 I would like to share the brief gist of "Technical skills" which I acquired and used practically in this journey:
 ✒ Power Query:-
 ↪ ETL(Extract, Transform , Load) software in Power Bi, M language,
✒ Data Modelling:-
 ↪ Establishing the relationships between tables.
✒ DAX language(Data Analysis Expression):-
 ↪ New Measure
 ↪ Calculated Column
✒ Rules for designing effective Dashboard
✒ Creating a Scroller

5.Used interactive elements like bar charts, line graphs, and tables to make insights accessible and actionable.


I extend my sincere appreciation to Dhaval Patel Hemanand Vadivel sir and whole Codebasics team for their guidance.
